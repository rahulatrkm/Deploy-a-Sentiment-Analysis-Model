# Deploy-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
In this project a recurrent neural network was constructed for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. This model was created using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, the model was deployed and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
